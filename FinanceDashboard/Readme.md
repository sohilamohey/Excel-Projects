# Finance Dashboard
1. Importing Data from Different Excel Sheets:
Utilizing Excel's data importing capabilities, data from multiple Excel sheets is imported into a single workbook. This allows for a comprehensive view of the data across different sources.
2. Creating Relations Using Data Model:
Leveraging Excel's Data Model functionality, relations are established between the imported tables based on suitable columns. This relational structure enhances data analysis by enabling seamless integration and analysis of related datasets.
3. Preprocessing with Power Query:
Power Query is employed for preprocessing tasks, such as data cleaning, transformation, and consolidation. This ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis and visualization.
4. Dashboard Creation Using Charts:
The processed data is visualized using various Excel chart types to create insightful dashboards. These dashboards provide a clear and intuitive representation of the data, allowing users to easily interpret trends, patterns, and insights.
